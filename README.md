![example workflow](https://github.com/ployt0/headless_selenium/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)

I have some private projects running Selenium. I want a sensible base project demonstrating Selenium to base these other projects' CI scripts off.

I also need tests for my website. So that's what purpose particular repository can serve.
